        <p>Hello. I am Jason Schmitt, currently residing in New Jersey, working as a Front End Engineer.</p>

        {{!-- <p>I started writing html/css in high school at age 15, making an angelfire website with the main content being photographs and videos of my friends and I skateboarding. Fast forward to today, I have obtained a degree concentrating in Software Engineering from UNC Charlotte, as well as have over 3 years of professional web development experience ranging from retail websites to banking to ecommerce to your local pizzeria.</p> --}}

        <p>With 4+ years of experience in a professional development environment, I find myself getting more and more interested in how web apps are built.</p>

        <p>My experience began with strictly writing static content updates throughout Lowes.com and m.lowes.com. Next, transitioning to a team who focused on writing client side javascript, delivering scripts that load on page load via adobe target and adobe dynamic tag manager to preform a/b testing and collect analytics throughout lowes.com and m.lowes.com.</p>

        <p>From there, an opportunity came up to work for an agency writing a/b test scripts on a number of fortune 500 company websites. So I took it and saw how it went, writing client side javascript a/b tests on the sites of toysrus.com, m.toysrus.com, suntrust.com, m.barnesandnobles.com, clinique.com, oppenheimer.com, uber.com, totalwine.com. I noticed I was writing only on the client side, and wanted to explore more about the server side, this is when I began a deep dive into node and full stack development.</p>

        <p>I now work as a front end developer for bank of america, writing styles that are rendered across merrill lynch web assets. Also writing and refactoring gulp tasks throughout different repos across the company, helping to optimize the css output files the team uses to deploy to production.</p>

        {{!-- <p>My professional website efforts include working on a/b testing and analytics as well as small projects for ecommerce websites.</p> --}}

        <p>Specialities: Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars, Responsive Web Design, Mobile Web, Git, Gulp. Looking for a git based agile team preferably working with node, mongodb, handlebars/react, sass, less, mvc/mv* architecture.</p>

        {{!-- <p>Below are the professional websites I have written html, css and javascript for.</p> --}}

        <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
